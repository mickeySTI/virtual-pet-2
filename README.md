# Virtual Pet 2 Project

This project allows us to practice pair programming, TDD, and Java fundamentals.

Virtual Pet allows the user to create their own virtual pet. Name it and give a description. 

The user then has 3 functions or actions they can take with their pet. The first option is to feed their pet. Second is to give their pet something to drink. Third option is to play with their pet. Each option impacts the status (Hunger, Thirst, Boredom) of their pet.
